Title: Give Your Code Blocks a Name
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Alex",
           family = "Knudson",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "aknudson@nevada.unr.edu")
Description: The main problem for those with anomic aphasia (anomia) is finding the 
    appropriate word to identify an object or person. It's the same problem for naming code 
    chunks in an Rmarkdown file. This package will do the work of naming your code blocks 
    for you in a customizable way.
